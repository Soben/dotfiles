# dotfiles

Sharing my configuration. This is set up for readability and usability on my part, with consistencies according to how I currently develop projects and work on my computer.

Everyone has their own methods and techniques. There are many other ways to set up this kind of set up, and this is my own.

## Requirements

These tools and configurations are built for

* Mac OSX
* oh-my-zsh (https://ohmyz.sh/)

## Management

I have this repository checked out as `~/Shell`

All scripts that I need to regularly manage and maintain that aren't in this folder are symlinked into this folder. These include:

* `.ssh` folder
* `.gitconfig` file
* `.zshrc` file

All of the above files are commonly located in `~` (home) directory unless otherwise noted.

In Visual Studio Code I created a project for the `~/Shell` folder, so I can switch to and manage the changes quickly.
